The purpose of this online resource is to explore health insurance coverage using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. A broad range of topics are covered within the dataset, but we will specifically focus on healthcare access, coverage, and expenditure across a multitude of factors such as over time and educational attainment. We explore three specific questions:
1. Access: Does higher educational attainment cause greater chance of acquiring medical insurance?
2. Coverage: What percentage of the population had health coverage?
3. Expenditure: How has the amount of money spent for medical care changed over the years?

This was done as a final project for my Population Health Metrics class.
